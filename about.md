> “Software is a craft — not just a job. Great code tells a story of clarity, care, and continuous learning.” – Riccardo Merolla

## About Me

Hi, I’m **Riccardo Merolla** — a Software Craftsman, Functional Programming enthusiast, and Fractional CTO who’s been shaping software teams and systems for more than 15 years.

I believe that great engineering is about **balancing elegance with pragmatism**, and that craftsmanship grows where curiosity and discipline meet. Over the years, I’ve helped startups and enterprises build scalable, event-driven architectures, mentor teams, and navigate the often messy intersection between business and technology.

Currently, I serve as an **Engineering Manager at Credem Bank**, where I focus on building internal dev teams, driving cloud transformation, and experimenting with AI-powered solutions using LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Before that, I led the **Payla** risk engine platform in the FinTech space and spent almost a decade as **CTO at ICT Group**, where I grew the engineering organization and designed distributed systems that powered automation, healthcare, and logistics products.

## My Craft

I started out as a full-stack developer — curious about how code could shape systems and people. Over time, my path led me deep into **Scala**, **ZIO**, and the **functional programming** ecosystem, where I found the tools and ideas that best express my engineering philosophy: **pure functions, composability, and simplicity**.

Beyond technology, my focus is on **teams and culture** — creating environments where engineers can thrive, collaborate openly, and take ownership of their craft.

## Toolbox

Here are some of the tools and ideas that have shaped my work:

- **Languages:** Scala, TypeScript, Python, Ruby, Java  
- **Architectures:** Microservices, Event-Driven Systems, Reactive Design  
- **Platforms:** AWS, Kubernetes, Kafka, PostgreSQL, MongoDB  
- **Frameworks:** ZIO, Akka, Quarkus, Tapir, Caliban, http4s  
- **Approaches:** Domain-Driven Design, Event Storming, Continuous Delivery  

## Learning Never Stops

I’ve always been a student of my craft. I’m constantly exploring new paradigms and sharpening my skills — from **Functional Programming in Scala (EPFL)** to **O’Reilly courses on Microservices, Event-Driven Systems, and DDD**. Learning keeps my thinking fresh and my teams inspired.
