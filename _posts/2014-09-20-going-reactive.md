I'm working on a new Reactive Web Application. The source code is on my [github repository](https://github.com/riccardomerolla/play-scala-akka-angular-mongodb).

In short words is an AngularJS - Scala - Play - Guice - PlayReactiveMongo - Akka full application stack with the aim of building a Reactive Web application.
